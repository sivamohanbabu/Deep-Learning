Deep Learning Introduction:
1.Deep learning is defines about to working on complex neural networks.This topic is subset of the  Machine Leaning.
Types Of Layers in Deep Learning:
1.Input Layer:
Recives the raw data to the machine

2.Hidden Layer:
Perform the computations in the hidden layer which is process the data 

3. OutPUT Layer:
provide the final output and prediction on classification

Activation functions in Deep Learning:
 
1.ReLU :Rectified Liner Unit:
which is used to the hidden layers to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simply used to speed up during the training of the data.
2.sigmoid:
map the values binary (0 and 1 in the layer ).
3.softmax:
conver the raw data (Score ) convert into the probabilty on the givendata.

Back propogation and  optimisation :

In this propogration step we use some of the example -mse(means standerd error),cross entropy stop: which are optimises the data.
